                    We are a family owned, beef producing farm located in Linn, Missouri. In one capacity or another, our family and lineage has been raising livestock and offering beef for America for over 75+ years. We take pride in not only ensuring the quality of the beef we produce, but also the health of our animals. We routinely check them for any health issues, and perform any necessary actions to be as humane as possible with treatment. We primarily sell black angus, and to ensure our customers receive the best tasting beef, go the extra mile and grain finish each head of cattle for 6 months prior to processing. This stands out among our peers, who often rely on only grass fed or a few weeks of grain. We appreciate the time and support we receive from our friends and peers, and especially our customers. Please reach out to us for any conerns or intrigues you have, thank you!
